    <h2>About My Design Choices</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The color I chose to emphasize text is 
            <span class="highlight">red</span> because it naturally draws attention.
        </li>

        <li>
            The color I chose to de-emphasize text is 
            <span class="muted">gray</span> since it is softer and less distracting.
        </li>

        <li>
            I selected my colors by thinking about contrast and readability. 
            I also tested combinations using an online color palette tool to 
            make sure everything looks clean and easy to read.
