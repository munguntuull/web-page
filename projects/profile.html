    <h1>Munguntuul</h1>

    <p>
        I enjoy reading books in my free time. 
        My favorite types are adventure and mystery because they are exciting and make me think. 
        Reading helps me relax and learn new ideas every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another hobby I like is drawing simple sketches. 
        It helps me express my feelings and be creative. 
        Even small drawings make me feel happy and proud.

    <p>
        I try to use my <strong>imagination</strong> every day. 
        Even when things are <em>simple</em>, creativity makes life fun. 
        Sometimes, I use <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> tools to learn new skills.
